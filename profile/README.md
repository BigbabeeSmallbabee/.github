## Hello and welcome to Big babee Small babee  ðŸ‘‹

This is an open source community, I am (trying) to build to encourage my students to actively participate in open source projects.

I have not much to share right now, except, I am just starting. more details will be added soon.

My name is Jay (Vijayasimha BR). I work as a full time freelance coding tutor. You can find out more about me, on my [github profile](https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana).

Thanks.
